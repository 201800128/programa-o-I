# Jogo Touros e Vacas/ Cows and Bulls Game
Python

# What is this?
This project was developed by me during my degree in Bioinformatics in the curricular unit "Programming Languages I".
The teacher asked to create a game "Bulls and Cows". The main goal of this game is to guess the number generated by the computer in the 
smallest attempt number.

# What I learned? 
With this project, I acquired some basic knowledge about, one of the most demanding programming languages in nowadays, python.
I've learned with this project how to use global variables, while loops, try and except and functions.
I hope it can be useful in the near future.
